# Tomorrow Night Theme for Processing 3 IDE

Processing 3 IDE ships with a light and blueish color theme. That's boring, isn't it? Simply replace the files `theme.txt` and `preferences.txt` and you'll be delighted by a more professional lookig IDE. The theme is based upon the [Tomorrow Night Theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) by Chris Kempson.

**Tested in Processing 3.5.3**

## Installation

### Windows:
**preferences.txt**  
Replace the `preferences.txt` located in `%UserProfile%\AppData\Roaming\Processing\`.

**theme.txt**  
Replace the `theme.txt` located in `%HomeDrive%\processing64\processing-3.3.6\lib\` or however your installation path might be.

### Mac OS:

Replace the `preferences.txt` located in `~/Library/Processing/preferences.txt`.

**theme.txt**  
Replace the `theme.txt` located in `~/Applications/Processing.app/Contents/Java/lib`.

## Further

I also recommend using the [Hack font](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/). It's nicer than the default, Source Code Pro, in my opinion.
